	 * be a check. "BET" - will bet on a hand - if a no limit game, must specify
	 * amount as described below. If previous bet is not met, hand will be
	 * folded. If the bet is higher than the previous bet, it will be a raise by
	 * the appropriate amount. "BET ONE" - will bet the value of the smallest
	 * button available to non-AI players. "BET TWO" - will bet the value of the
	 * second button. "BET THREE" - will be the value of the third button.
	 * "BET FOUR" - will bet the value of the fourth button. "BET POT" - will
	 * bet an amount equal to the pot. "BET ONE ONE THREE" - the 5 bet options
	 * from abouve can be combined to produce different bets. For example, to
	 * bet twice the pot you should do the next line "BET POT POT" - bet twice
	 * the pot. "RAISE" - will raise if its an option. If not an option, the AI
	 * will call. If a no limit game, then the amount must be specified the same
	 * way the bet amount is specified. The difference is the raise will start
	 * with the previous bet and increase. "ALLIN" - go All-In in a no limit
	 * game.
	 *

 * 
 * 
 * There is also a hand evaluator class which can be used to get a floating
 * point value of the player hand. Its use can be summarized as follows:
 * 
 * Construct an instance of the class with the following statement:
 * HandEvaluator he = new HandEvaluator();
 * 
 * The following overloaded fucntion can be used: float he.rankHand( Card c1 );
 * float he.rankHand( Card c1, Card c2 ); float he.rankHand( Card c1, Card c2,
 * Card c3 ); float he.rankHand( Card c1, Card c2, Card c3, Card c4 ); float
 * he.rankHand( Card c1, Card c2, Card c3, Card c4, Card c5 );
 * 
 * Generally, you should use the Hand.get*Card() functions to pass the cards as
 * arguments. All of these functions will give the cards passed as arguments,
 * and floating point score which can be broken down as follows.
 * 
 * Royal Straight Flush = 150.0f Five of a kind = 135.0f - 149.99999f Straight
 * flush = 120.0f - 134.99999f Four of a kind = 105.0f - 119.99999f Full House =
 * 90.0f - 104.99999f Flush = 75.0f - 89.99999f Straight = 60.0f - 74.99999f
 * Three of a kind = 45.0f - 59.99999f Two Pair = 30.0f - 44.99999f Pair = 15.0f
 * - 29.99999f High Card = 0.0f - 14.99999f
 * 
 * The higher the number is in the range, the better of that type of hand it is.
 * The decimal places make up the kicker(s)
 * 
 * 
 * A static function can also be used to actually print out the name of the hand
 * (including card names) based on the passed float value: static String
 * HandEvaluator.nameHand( float f ); for example: HandEvaluator.nameHand( 74.0f
 * ) returns the String "Straight: Ace high"
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * One last note...for debugging:
 * 
 * System.out.println( String s ); can concatenate strings by use of the + sign.
 * Most everything will print to screen nicely without formatting needed. EX -
 * prints out name, pot, and two hole cards. System.out.println( name +
 * "'s bet.  " + server.getPot() + "    " + hand.getHoleCard(0) + "  " +
 * hand.getHoleCard(1) );
