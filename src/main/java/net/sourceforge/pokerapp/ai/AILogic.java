 * |  0.96   | 10/08/04 | Added lots of functions that should be common to all AI       | *
 * |         |          | players is player chooses to use them.                        | *
 * |  0.97   | 11/10/04 | Change gameName to gameClass - safer to check class name      | *
 * |  0.99   | 12/23/04 | Add actionNum variables to this class. Can be used by the AI  | *
 * |         |          | to determine which phase of the game it is in.                | *
 * |  0.99   | 02/08/05 | Add memory variable to this class so that the AI can have a   | *
